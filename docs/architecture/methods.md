  - [Spike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_(software_development))

    > A spike is a product-testing method (...) that uses the simplest possible program to explore potential solutions. It is used to determine how much work will be required to solve or work around a software issue. Typically, a 'spike test' involves gathering additional information or testing for easily reproduced edge cases. The term is used in agile software development approaches like Scrum or Extreme Programming.
