## Puppet agent

### Installation on [Windows](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/install_windows.html)

Go to [Download page](https://downloads.puppetlabs.com/windows/puppet5/) and select the version that you need (`puppet-agent-x64-latest.msi` for example).

```bash
# install the puppet agent
msiexec /qn /norestart /i path\to\puppet-agent-5.X.Y-x64.msi PUPPET_MASTER_SERVER=mypuppetmastername /l*v C:\msipuppetlog.txt
# follow the progress with C:\msipuppetlog.txt (with baretail for example), it takes severals seconds, the file should end with:
# MSI (c) (C8:DC) [10:40:39:503]: MainEngineThread is returning 0
sc config "puppet" start= disabled
sc stop "puppet"
```

### Agent commands

```bash
# launch manually the puppet agent
puppet agent --test

# launch locally puppet code (no puppet server needed), see https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/5.3/man/apply.html
puppet apply --modulepath="modules;site" --hiera_config="hiera.yaml" .\manifests\site.pp

# display active configuration
puppet config print

## Puppet server

It is also known as **Puppet master**.
You can review the procedure to install a Puppet server on this [page](./server_installation_centos.md).

### Server commands (CentOS)

```bash
# start puppet server
service puppetserver start
# systemctl start puppetserver.service

# get puppet server service info
service puppetserver status
# shortcut for systemctl status puppetserver.service

# stop puppet server
service puppetserver stop
# systemctl stop puppetserver.service

# get logs from system journal
journalctl -xe

# get puppet agent service info
service puppet status

# executes r10k ([usage](https://github.com/puppetlabs/r10k/blob/master/doc/dynamic-environments/usage.mkd))
cd /etc/puppetlabs/r10k
sudo /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin/r10k deploy environment --puppetfile

# list certificates to be validated
sudo /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin/puppet cert list

# sign a certificate
sudo /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin/puppet cert sign xxxxxx

# follow logs in real time
tail -f /var/log/puppetlabs/puppetserver/puppetserver.log
tail -f /var/log/puppetlabs/puppetserver/puppetserver-access.log
```

### Configuration files ([doc](https://puppet.com/docs/puppetserver/5.1/configuration.html))

| File path                                       | Details                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `/etc/sysconfig/puppetserver`                   | Puppet server configuration file        |
| `/etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/conf.d/auth.conf` | Puppet serveur auth configuration file ([doc](https://puppet.com/docs/puppetserver/5.1/config_file_auth.html)) |
| `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf`            | Puppet agent configuration file         |
| `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/hiera.yaml`             | Hiera configuration file ([doc](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/5.3/hiera_intro.html)) |

### Directory structure

* `/etc/puppetlabs`: base path
* `/etc/puppetlabs/code`: Puppet code managed by git, this is where r10k will
* `/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments`: Definition per environment, this is where r10k will create folders per git repository branches (production, staging, etc.)
* `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet`: Puppet Agent configuration
* `/etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver`: PuppetServer configuration
* `/etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/conf.d`: Settings (see [Puppet Server Configuration](https://puppet.com/docs/puppetserver/5.1/configuration.html))
* `/etc/puppetlabs/r10k`: r10k configuration
* `/opt/puppetlabs`: Internal Puppet stuff, binaries, etc
* `/var/log/messages`: Puppet Agent logs
* `/var/log/puppetlabs`: Other logging
* `/tmp`: Used by the installer (issues if set ‘noexec’)
